    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br><span style="color:red;">[Turning her head a little.]</span>Have you been round the garden, Miss Wangel?<br>
    <b>HILDA.</b><br>Yes, I have been taking a look at it.<br>
    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>And found some flowers too, I see.<br>
    <b>HILDA.</b>Yes, indeed! There are such heaps of them in among the bushes.<br>
    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b>Are there, really? Still? You see I scarcely ever go there.<br>
    <b>HILDA.</b><br><span style="color:red;">[Closer.]</span> What! Don't you take a run down into the garden every day,
    then?<br>
    <b>MRS. SOLNESS.</b><br><span style="color:red;">[With a faint smile.]</span> I don't "run" anywhere, nowadays.
